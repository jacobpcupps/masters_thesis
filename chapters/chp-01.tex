\section{Open Mike Eagle and Nocando's ``Unapologetic''}

Before landing several projects on best-of-the-decade lists from outlets like \textit{Pitchfork},
\textit{Brooklyn Vegan}, and \textit{Hip-Hop Golden Age}, the L.A.-based rapper Open Mike Eagle 
started off the decade with a declaration. His first studio LP, \textit{Unapologetic Art Rap},
coined the subgenre art rap, which Eagle defines as ``a shorthand for leftfield and avant-garde
rap music'' that he ``has spent his career redefining and expanding.''\footnote{
    \cite{openmikeeagle}.}
And not just Eagle himself, but so too the world of American hip-hop fandom around him: in 2020,
the  former Editor-in-Chief of \textit{Rap Genius} Shawn Setaro claimed that: ``[Art Rap] is a 
movement that has become one of the most vital things happening in hip-hop today. Boundaries are
stretched constantly, in a way that recalls the innovations that took place in rap's Golden Age, 
without aping that era's  sonics.''\footnote{
    \cite{shawnsetaroWhyYouShould2020}.}

If Setaro's claim holds merit, then we should interrogate how the music being received as art rap
comes to be known in that way\textemdash not just in its idiomatic ``sonics'' but also its themes,
techniques, and approaches. Max Bell attempted this by digging through Bandcamp's ``art rap'' genre
tag for \textit{Bandcamp  Daily}. After purporting that ``is antithetical to terrestrial radio 
station playlists,'' he notes a few unifying stylistic traits ``including but not limited to 
left-field, forward thinking production, unconventional song structures and cadences, songs written
from the perspectives of fictional characters, explicit and protracted engagement with social and 
political issues, and absurdist metaphors and similes.''\footnote{
    \cite{maxbellWalkAvantGardeWorld2017}.} 
Bell's attempt at a definition is somewhat helpful, but its breadth offers only a partial picture, 
especially due to the qualifications it must make.\footnote{
    Bell mentions that Kendrick Lamar's work, both commercially successful and radio friendly,
    still ``pushes the boundary of rap.'' After listing the sonic qualities he identified, he
    also states that ``labelling a song/album `art rap' doesn't mean that it's \textit{only}
    that.''} 
It seems, more than a decade later, the hip-hop community is still asking the question posed by
the seventh track on Eagle's \textit{Unapologetic Art Rap}: ``WTF is Art Rap?''

Eagle and the guest emcee Nocando offer a glimpse at a definition within the lyrical content of
the eighth track ``Unapologetic.'' As art-rappers, Nocando claims that they are small-time enough
to identify with an underground scene:
\settowidth{\versewidth}{I dress nice but I ain't no goddamned sneaker freak.}
    \begin{verse}[\versewidth]
        \small I'm underground, man, like I'm beneath the streets, \\ 
        \small I dress nice but I ain't no goddamned sneaker freak.\footnote{
            \cite{openmikeeagle2010}.}
    \end{verse}
At the same time, the two have more cach√© than the ``rapper friends''  of the local  
``scenesters'':
\settowidth{\versewidth}{There's a reason I'm performing after him.}
    \begin{verse}[\versewidth]
        \small Now everybody's got a rapper friend, \\ 
        \small But my name's higher on the flyer,\\
        \small There's a reason I'm performing after him.
    \end{verse}
On Eagle's end, he envisions art rap as dedicated to a particular audience:
\settowidth{\versewidth}{Who make sketches and daydream the whole class.}
    \begin{verse}[\versewidth]
        \small This to all the adolescent negro lads, \\
        \small Who make sketches and daydream the whole class. \\
        \small In `96, they would have been De La Soul Fans, \\
        \small (In 2010), it's My Chemical Romance.
    \end{verse}
At the same time, he is troubled by a whiter (and perhaps less-initiated) audience his art rap 
parties have attracted:
\settowidth{\versewidth}{Came to watch us battle and cackle like Fran Drescher.}
    \begin{verse}[\versewidth]
        \small Scene's built on the backs of black rappers, \\
        \small (Somehow) when I'm asking for cash you can't answer. \\ 
        \small Descendants of the folks that shackled my ancestors, \\ 
        \small Came to watch us battle and cackle like Fran Drescher.
    \end{verse}
The above quatrain also shows Eagle's concern with financial success. At the same time, however, 
Eagle has a clear conception of another lucrative type of rap music that has sold itself over to 
the entertainment  industry:
\settowidth{\versewidth}{Cause my little brother never heard of Little Brother \textellipsis}
    \begin{verse}[\versewidth]
        \small Cause my little brother never heard of Little Brother \textellipsis \\ 
        \small The only [rappers] he can discover \\
        \small Are the ones who please Viacom's executive n----- lovers.
    \end{verse}

Even from a brief lyrical analysis, ``Unapologetic'' creates a complex picture of the (black,
masculine) identities of the emcees on the track.\footnote{
    } 
The two focus on communicating their identities lyrically, but text alone does not construct
identity in rap: musical content plays a role in this. This chapter considers ``Unapologetic'' 
as an early manifestation of the music the thesis overall intends to address. Although (as my 
title suggests) I will eventually come to contextualize the track within a subgenre I call 
underground, I first consider its relationship to some categories in rap which have received 
attention in recent music scholarship: namely, Amanda Sewell's conception of the ``nerdcore''
subgenre, and Adam Krims  and Justin Williams ``jazz/bohemian'' rap constructions. I come to 
reject these designations for  ``Unapologetic'' because of the problems with contextualizing 
the song within a single sound or style, instead looking towards listening practices in hip-hop
to come to a definition of underground that will serve as a guide for what this thesis explores.


\section{``Unapologetic''\textemdash Nerdcore or Jazz Rap?} \label{unapologeticnerdcorejazz}

The lyrical content, themes, and sonic palette of ``Unapologetic'' suggest a number of connections 
to genres which have been previously theorized in music studies. The construction of its beat and 
its lyrical focus on intelligence place it within a lineage of nerdcore hip-hop, a less commercial
type of hip-hop from the 1990s and early 2000s. Additionally, its lyrical focus on the artistry of 
hip-hop suggests a link to another genre, jazz rap in the early-to-mid nineties, which also dealt 
with similar topics. In this section, I consider whether ``Unapologetic'' satisfactorily fits within
one generic category or the other.

Nerdcore, according to Amanda Sewell, ``happens when technologically savvy, verbally precocious, and
socially marginalized people begin to make hip-hop using their skill sets and 
experiences.''\footnote{
    \autocite[223]{amandasewellNerdcoreHiphop2015}.}. 
Drawing on discussions with MC Frontalot, a pioneer of nerdcore, she describes a few methods by which
the genre is  constructed. One, more superficially, comes through lyrical reference: nerdcore rappers 
often discuss ``nerdy'' media  (sci-fi, fantasy, comics, anime) or ``nerdy'' career paths (astrophysics,
computer engineering, or genetics.) Beyond this, nerdcore emcees also speak to experiences shared by 
people (men) who can not ``fit into the traditional expectations of masculinity, especially as 
a teenager.''\footnote{
    \autocite[225]{amandasewellNerdcoreHiphop2015}.} 

Given such a definition, ``Unapologetic'' presents itself as nerdcore through several discint methods. 
First, both the track and the LP it is housed on share a grab-bag of references with nerdcore. On Eagle's
liner notes video for ``Art Rap Party,'' he talks about a gathering where ``of course, it's gonna be a 
little nerdy[.] \textellipsis We could talk about anime, \textellipsis political stuff, exploring realms
conversationally that aren't in the typical rap song.''\footnote{
    \cite{openmikeeagleVideoLinerNotes2010}.}
Likewise, Eagle positions art rap in a space at the periphery of rap\textemdash one where ``intelligent
folks go to dig on intelligent music.''\footnote{
    \cite{openmikeeagleVideoLinerNotes2010}.} 
Eagle includes young black men in this narrative, those who may not fit the scripts for masculinity that
are highlighted other rap subgenres. The ``adolescent negro lads'' Eagle dedicates ``Unapologetic'' to 
are inclined  to ``rebellin' since it's the first sign of intelligence,'' and his similarly intelligent
music may speak to that.

One final element of ``Unapologetic'' reaches my listening ear as nerdcore although it is not articulated
in Sewell's definition. The primary harmonic content of its beat is constructed from a bitcrushed synthesizer,
outlining diatonic harmony in G major. Along with the two-bar drum loop, it does not create a complex musical
texture, but it does create one that carries meaning for the listener. More superficially, the timbre evokes 
some connection to video game soundtracks (a stereotypical nerdy past time) from the 1980s, 1990s, and early 
2000s, which feature frequently feature 8-bit soundtracks. Additionally, I believe the changes in timbre 
between  the two loops (e.g., 0:00--0:04 and 0:51--1:01) ask us as listeners to engage with the producer 
as ``technologically savvy''\textemdash perhaps then, too, the emcees.

Sewell's definition helps contextualize notions of intelligece, but it does not account for ``Unapologetic''
in totality, especially because she claims that nerdcore is ``almost all white, middle-class, and 
[suburban]."\footnote{
    \autocite[223]{amandasewellNerdcoreHiphop2015}.} 
Although ``Unapologetic'' may be rapped by emcees with nerdy proclivities, that is ont the full extent of
what the track communicates about their identities. Eagle and Nocando are not just outsiders due to their 
nerdinesss but also because they are \emph{artists}, carving out modest success at the outskirts of the rap
landscape. In this way, ``Unapologetic'' reflects ideologies that helped to construct the jazz-rap (or bohemian
rap) subgenre that emerged during hip-hop's golden age.

In developing his genre system for rap music, Krims examines a number of distinct subcategories that were 
present in the rap industry by 1994. In particular, he cites two subgenres\textemdash in his parlance, 
jazz/bohemian rap and ``reality'' rap\textemdash that articulated themselves as alternatives to gangsta
rap, a style was closely aligned with an idea of the commercial mainstream.\footnote{
    \autocite[64--65]{adamkrimsRapMusicPoetics2000}. Krims offers two case studies\textemdash The Roots' 
    ``What They Do'' and RZA's introduction on Wu-Tang Clan's \textit{Wu-Tang Forever}\textemdash as 
    instances of each genre directly addressing what it conceived to be the commercial mainstream at
    the time.}
In the case of the former, jazz became a sonic profile closely associated with alternative identity:
A Tribe Called Quest, Digable Planets, and The Roots all used jazz, either via sampling or performed
live, as a sonic marker of this style.

Williams heightens the connection between jazz and artistry within the realm of mid-nineties hip-hop. 
He argues that the above groups used jazz and other Black sonic profiles as a method of constructing 
their music as a high art taken with respect the rap industry. They drew on certain musical elements
that functioned as jazz codes: signifiers in the instrumentation that reach audiences as having a jazz
feel, even if their sound source is not specifically a jazz record.\footnote{
    \autocite[55]{justinawilliamsRhyminStealinMusical2013}.}
That audiences appreciated these sounds as art, he argues, was precipitated by two elements: (1) through
the efforts of  musicians like Wynton Marsalis during the 1980s, jazz had become an institutional and 
``serious'' art form,\footnote{
    \autocite[48--52]{justinawilliamsRhyminStealinMusical2013}. The directionality of Williams' claim 
    is important to note here: jazz-rappers did not use these sounds because they heard them as jazz 
    as a serious art form (more likely, jazz was music that permeated family record collections), but
    that because of the position jazz held within mainstream American culture and because jazz rappers
    articulated a mainstream/underground divide textually, jazz \emph{sounded as} art to the hip-hop 
    community.} 
and (2) jazz-rappers coupled these sonic borrowings with lyrical and visual significations of their 
own alternative identity.\footnote{
    \autocite[55--64]{justinawilliamsRhyminStealinMusical2013}.}
Audiences were therefore poised to experience the music as a sort of artistic substyle within the genre.

Could Eagle's art rap simply be jazz rap, re-articulated in a new decade? The answer is more complicated 
than it may seem on its surface. Although ``Unapologetic'' does not draw on the same jazz codes mentioned
above, many tracks by artists working in a similar vein do; jazz and other Black sonic profiles perhaps 
function as a sonic shorthand for alternative identity in the 2010s like they did in the 1990s.\footnote{
    In the appendix, I have collected a few tracks by artists whose music I engage with throughout 
    this project that either sample or interpolate lyrical content from pieces that exhibit jazz codes 
    (see Table~\ref{tab:jazz_references}.)}
Eagle also makes reference to jazz rap when conceptualizing his audience: he explicitly says, if born a 
bit earlier, ``they would have been De La Soul Fans.'' In his estimation, the ideal demographic for art 
rap overlaps with the fan-base of jazz rap, separated by a generation. Finally, indeed most importantly,
art rap reinscribes the same divisions within the rap industry that served as the lyrical focus of jazz 
rap. Eagle's criticism of the types of artists that ``please Viacom's [executives]'' and his  estimation
of his own work as a ``black man's art'' allow him to construct a similar dichotomy between him and popular
rapper's in his time that A Tribe Called Quest's Q-Tip did between himself and popular rappers in the 1990s.
Both art and jazz rappers make themselves out to be bohemians within the music industry; thus the listeners 
who can appreciate each style are connoisseurs amongst the listening audience of rap music.

Like nerdcore, the designation jazz/bohemian rap speaks to some aspect of ``Unapologetic'' but likewise does
not completely account for the track. Even if it shares an ideology with jazz rap, the sonic profile of 
``Unapologetic'' does not fit neatly into the generic category Krims and Williams construct. Granted, each 
author acknowledges the possibility for a stylistic eclecticism that reaches beyond jazz sonically; however,
the groups that receive their focus (A Tribe Called Quest, De La Soul, Digable Planets, Jungle Brothers, and
The Roots) all rely to \emph{some} degree on the sound of jazz in their music. Without jazz codes to signify
generic construction,  ``Unapologetic'' cannot reach listeners as jazz rap\textemdash at least not by the same
methods  that golden-age jazz rappers did.

Eagle's ``Unapologetic''\textemdash his whole conception of art rap as a moment at the start of the 
2010s\textemdash articulates something that is at once new in hip-hop while relating to ideas, sounds, and 
genres from throughout hip-hop's history. Although the track's ``tech-y'' sound and construction of 
``intelligence'' intimates some connection to nerdcore, the designation falls short because of nerdcore's 
historically white positionality and lack of concern with its own construction as art. On the other hand,
to situate ``Unapologetic'' within the lineage of jazz/bohemian rap does not adequately account for the 
timbral qualities or ``codes'' of the track but gets closer to the topical focus and positionality art
rap affords itself with respect to the mainstream.

\section{Hip-Hop Practice and Listening as Meditation} \label{listeningasmeditation}

In the previous section, I argue that ``Unapologetic'' is characterized not by one subgenre like
nerdcore or jazz rap. Instead, I locate it within a practice of listening, a type of sonic engagement
I will term \emph{listening as meditation}. Historically,this listening practice is abundant in all 
stages of the making of any kind of hip-hop\textemdash from its conception in the mind of the producer 
and emcee, to its performance live or in studio, and eventually its reception by the listener. In this
section, I show that practitioners throughout hip-hop's history and Eagle himself promote this style 
of listening foregrounded in underground hip-hop, one that engenders a deep immersion in hip-hop as a
musical form.

The phrase listening as meditation serves as an inversion of the mind-body dualism invoked by earlier 
popular music discourses. To be sure, by invoking ``listening'' as a unifying thread amongst a wide 
variety of stylistic manifestations, I am inviting a tacit definition of the underground as ``hip-hop 
to be \emph{listened} to'' as distinct from ``to be danced to'' or ``merely heard.''\footnote{
    My focus on listening runs the risk of positioning underground hip-hop as a ``transmission of 
    mind--mind messages'' between composer and listener (see~\autocite[20]{suzanneg.cusickFeministTheoryMusic1994}.) 
    While this style of inquiry still characterizes a great deal of music-theoretical scholarship,
    my reservations arise from the potential for erasing the embodied experience of performers 
    (who tend to be the composers in my repertory as well) and the listeners within the exchange 
    that happens in underground hip-hop. I therefore intend with my term for this mode of listening
    (``as meditation'') to be interpreted as a unified mind-body practice.}
Part of the trouble with such a definition is its potential use as a justification for excluding certain
musics from being objects of critical inquiry. Moreover, my choice to prioritize discussing this music 
as an engagement of one's musical intellect does not exclude its use as ``dance'' music, nor as a music
that does not engender embodied responses. The metaphor of listening as meditation, then, proposes a 
unification of cognitive and embodied responses that characterize engagement with underground hip-hop. 
In short, it is an argument that will, in the coming pages, put this chapter's epigraph to the test 
(that ``Listening correctly can cause introspecting.'')

At each point in the process of making hip-hop, and indeed throughout different points in its history as
a music form, several practitioners have evinced that their listening exhibits a meditative engagement with
music. The rapper-producer Count Bass D suggests that this style of listening guides his process for sample
selection and composition for the introduction to his 2002 track ``Truth to Light'': 
    \begin{quote}
        \small Songs that really I like a whole lot, that I've liked over the years, kind of run through my head all
        the time and so they kind of creep into songs. \textellipsis Unless you know [Nice \& Smooth's ``Funky
        for You''], you don't know who I'm talking about or what I'm talking about, but to people who are in
        the know, it strengthens their faith that the things I'm talking about that they don't understand may
        have some relevance to them in time.\footnote{
            \autocite[100]{mickeyhessHipHopDead2007}.}
    \end{quote}
Count focuses on familiarity, being ``in the know'' with the source material, as a requirement for parsing 
his dialogue with the Nice \& Smooth at the beginning of the track, but his discussion also reveals listening
norms within the hip-hop community. First, Count as a producer engaged with ``Funky for You'' regularly enough
over a long period of time that his decision to dialogue with the artists' ad-libs on the original recording 
felt subliminal and ``[crept] into'' the track. Second, he expects that his audience will have engaged with 
the material on a similarlevel, enough to ``know what [he's] talking about.'' Finally, and perhaps most 
interestingly, Count conceives of a \emph{type} of listener, who may not know the source material but as a
result of their familiarity with the listening norms in the genre trusts will come to them ``in time'' as
they listen further and more broadly beyond ``Truth to Light.'' Such a listener is the \emph{meditative} 
listener, the type of listener Count considers his primary audience.

The meditative listening process for the emcee is similar to the producer's in that the emcee listens with
enough regularity and focus that imitating other artists' can become subconscious, to an extent where it can
problematic for their on writing process. Eagle explains that because of his listening interactions with the
emcee MF DOOM's flow, ``he has to be  careful with [DOOM's] flow, because [he] can almost get into [DOOM's] 
mind in terms of how he writes.''\footnote{
    \cite{estellecaswellRappingDeconstructedBest2016}.} 
Eagle characterizes his depth of engagement with DOOM as something that could turn into a problem because 
it would be easy for him to write a verse in the same exact manner that DOOM does and thus turn into something
g more derivative than he would like. Again the practitioner positions their compositional choices as a 
subconscious choice based on deep engagement with models for composing that show up in their listening. For 
Eagle as an emcee, this listening has occurred with enough frequency, depth, and regularity that he subsumed
DOOM's style of flow into his own and needs to consciously choose to offset his writing from this practice 
at times.

Finally, hip-hop practitioners show that listening as meditation informs their interpretation of performances 
by other practitioners; they envision the artists they interact with as meditative listeners, who then serve
as guides for further meditative listening. The Bronx DJ Grand Wizzard Theodore describes, when hearing a 
record through DJ Kool Herc's soundsystem, ``[it] made you listen to a record and made you appreciate the 
record even more. He would play a record that you listened to every day and you would be like `Wow, that 
record has \emph{bells} in it?' It's like you heard instruments in the record that you never thought the 
record even had.''\footnote{
    \autocite[139]{christabronGlassHiphopProduction2015}.} 
Theodore's description shows that even within the context of a block party, hip-hop can be listened to
in a way that brings about new depths to the music beyond the standard forms of engagement.

\section{Definitions and Limitations of Underground} \label{undergrounddeflims}

In the above sections, I have examined stylistic and thematic traits in two musicological 
constructions  of subgenre\textemdash nerdcore and jazz rap\textemdash considering Eagle's
``Unapologetic'' as an example that does not neatly fit in either category. Additionally, I
considered how Eagle participates in a historical practice shared by a number of hip-hop 
musicians: a practice where musicians are listeners first, engaging with the music at a meditative
level. In this section, I argue that the designation \emph{underground} in hip-hop is defined 
by meditative listening. Fans of underground hip-hop are encouraged to engage with the subgenre 
as meditative listeners because underground hip-hop musicians exhibit meditative listening in
their music (re-articulating the practice, too, in interviews). As a result of the perceived 
closeness to the artist that characterizes the underground, listeners choose to engage with
the music in a similarly meditative fashion.

Before I arrive at this definition, I need to address three conceptions of the underground 
which I believe to be faulty and therefore do not wish to import in my definition. Specifically,
a definition of underground cannot meaningfully be constructed from discourses of artistry, 
authenticity, or commerciality. These three metrics permeate popular discussions of what 
makes music underground, so addressing them out front will prove useful in elucidating what
I wish to focus on: namely, listening practice and methods of constructing the music.

Defining underground hip-hop as an art genre invokes discourses around what makes a piece 
of music beautiful, a metric that is at once too broad to define and too based in subjective
experience to communicate effectively. Although rappers like Eagle have constructed their 
personas in this way, and in fact fans buy into such constructions, I find it telling that 
such discourses are often short-lived. As early as 2013, Eagle raps:

\settowidth{\versewidth}{I used to throw these sensitive parties for art rap,}
    \begin{verse}[\versewidth]
        \small I used to throw these sensitive parties for art rap, \\
        \small No regrets, but I was foolish to start that. \\
        \small Sophisticated fuckers left a bitch of a bar tab, \\
        \small And now we just throw pizza parties.\footnote{
        \cite{milo2013}.}
    \end{verse}
Eagle's indictment of the art rap scene came relatively quickly on the heels of his 
construction of identity as an art-rapper, in a feature only a few projects later than
he unapologetically declared it. Though his lyrics focus on the pretension and bourgeois
tastes of the fans it garnered him, I also  wonder if writing ``artful'' rap lost its 
meaning. As a listener, I find it hard to describe whether something reaches me as artful;
for instance, I do not, as Justin Williams suggests, hear a piece based around a jazz sample
as more artistic than, say, something constructed from DAW-based synthesizers simply because
of the importance jazz is given in contemporary American culture.\footnote{
    For my discussion on Williams' argument that jazz rap reaches listeners as a  high art, 
    see section~\ref{unapologeticnerdcorejazz}.} 
Rap music's artistry seems less quantifiable (and more personally defined) than its undergroundness.

Invoking authenticity to define underground also proves to be a slippery metric, in perhaps a 
similar way to artistry. This definition finds purchase in popular discourse as well because of
artists who tie it closely to the early, pre-recorded era of hip-hop. Fab 5 Freddy summarized 
this mentality when discussing  his role as the writer for the 1982 film \textit{Wild Style}. 
The writers set the story before the 1979 release of Sugarhill Gang's single ``Rapper's Delight'' 
because ``[they] wanted to go back to a few years earlier\textellipsis \emph{when hip-hop was 
completely underground, when the form was raw and pure.}''\footnote{
    \autocite[23]{justinawilliamsRhyminStealinMusical2013}. Emphasis my own. The release
    of ``Rapper's Delight'' is often thought of as the moment when hip-hop went commercial.}
Fab 5 Freddy's association of undergroundness with rawness or purity illustrates one type
of a way that listeners, critics, and fans alike make sense of hip-hop, yet, once again, I 
wonder if the terms have any bearing on the sound of underground hip-hop as it exists in a
commercialized landscape decades later. To me, discourses of authenticity seem to be based 
on subjective, evaluative judgements a listener makes.

Finally, a definition of underground based in commerciality may seem valuable at a surface 
level, but modernmethods for discovering and participating in cultures of listening problematize
such a conception. Commerciality may very well be the metric for judging the authenticity of a 
rap song; an artist's commercial success can be tied to whether or not a listener receives them 
as  underground. However, commercial success is not the sole quality that constructs undergroundness. 
As Anthony Kwame Harrison argues in his ethnographic foray into the San Francisco underground 
hip-hop scene, ``the label `underground' can be applied to everything from Grammy-nominated 
artists like Common and the Roots to groups like The Latter, who once boasted(!) of having sold
only two copies of one of their CDs.''\footnote{
    \autocite[9]{anthonykwameharrisonHipHopUnderground2009}.}
Harrison also offers insight from from Kegs One, the artist and proprietor of the San Francisco 
hip-hop shop Below the Surface, which further elucidates that degrees of commerciality exist 
within underground as a category:
    \begin{quote}
        \small I have a few different people that are into the more `commercial underground' stuff, 
        but then 95 percent of my customers are here for the  literal four-track tapes. You 
        know,  dirty-sounding, low-budget, in-the-room, in-the-closet recorded 
        tapes.\footnote{
            Quoted in \autocite[10]{anthonykwameharrisonHipHopUnderground2009}.}
    \end{quote}
Each point illustrates that several levels of success can all maintain underground as a quality:
all the way from The Latter's two records sold, to the more successful Bay-area artists who are
``just below the surface,'' on up musicians like The Roots, who signed to Def-Jam in 2006, and 
have been Jimmy Fallon's in-house band since 2009. For acts to have varying degrees of success 
and still be considered underground points to some metric beyond commerciality being invoked to 
define the quality of undergroundness.

The definition Harrison constructs is based on an ethos he observes in the Bay-area underground,
and his observations support serve as a basis for my own definition based in listening practices.
In particular, he notes ``the idea of a blurring, thinning, almost imperceptible line that separate
artists and fans'' and ``an intimacy of the fan bases [underground artists] tend to 
attract.''\footnote{
    \autocite[10--11]{anthonykwameharrisonHipHopUnderground2009}.}
Although, like Harrison, I believe this ethos decreases in palpability as an artists commercial 
success and notoriety increases, these artists are still stylistic participants in underground 
hip-hop because this ethos can be perceived in the music. I believe that this intimacy can be 
perceived in the way an artist models meditative listening for fans; in effect, the music shows
the artist acting as a listener (as a \emph{fan} themselves), and fans experience a type of
intimacy in that recognition.

This perception of intimacy and the acts of meditative listening it engenders are core to 
understanding how a listener experiences underground hip-hop. Underground is not a style of 
hip-hop codified by one sonic practice, nor by one thematic focus, but rather by a multiplicity 
of both, guided by the ways in which the musicians demonstrate their relation to a network of 
practices and focuses. Underground hip-hop artists that bring together a multiplicity of 
experiences in their work model a listening practice for the fan, who may at first intentionally
re-navigate these listening networks for themselves or may\textemdash in time, as Count Bass D 
suggests\textemdash come to trust that these networks exist and will come to them through 
their own paths of musical experience.


\section{Outline of the Thesis}

Working from the definition of underground as a practice of meditative listening shared between
fans and artists participating in the subgenre, this thesis focuses on transcribing and analyzing
a repertory of underground rap songs, attempting to uncover how the quality of undergroundness
manifests within beats and flows. Harnessing a definition not limited to one sonic style opens 
up my repertory across practices in various stylistic settings, allowing me to examine how in
any instance certain techniques communicate meaning to a listener, even if the lyrics themselves
speak less explicitly to identity than ``Unapologetic.'' In short, I I am interested in how musical
texts ``sound'' the underground, agnostic of any stylistic approach.

My reading of musical texts agentially is bound up in Loren Kajikawa's notion of ``sounding'' in
rap music. Kajikawa argues that the rap song is a medium for transmitting identities and meaning 
between the artist and the listener.\footnote{
    \autocite[2]{lorenkajikawaSoundingRaceRap2015}.}
Where his scholarship focuses on the encoding of racial and gender identities, mine will focus on
a subsequent matter: how an artist navigates mainstream expectations about these identities, and 
in so doing asks you to listen in a new, more meditative way as a result of their navigation.

The two primary chapters in this project will interrogate the overlapping yet distinct methods 
by which hip-hop musicians sound the underground. Chapter~\ref{chapter2} focuses on beatmaking,
arguing that producers create underground hip-hop beats by avoiding fixed loops and regular 
sample lengths.\footnote{
    Justin A. Williams argues that all of rap's subgenres deconstruct this notion 
    (see \cite{justinawilliamsBeatsFlowsResponse2009}). Williams' critique of the musical-theoretical
    focus on repetition in hip-hop is foundational to my approach; however, my work in this chapter 
    deals more with underground producers' deliberate choice to disrupt repetition beyond layering
    elements in and out of the music.} 
In particular, I examine how producers introduce variety primarily through digital editing 
techniques that mimic the live, improvisatory roots of the genre within a broadly repetitive 
musical texture. I employ two distinct methods of transcription based on other scholar's methods
for beat transcription\textemdash namely, Kajikawa's breakbeat transcriptions\footnote{
    \autocite[29--30 and 36--37]{lorenkajikawaSoundingRaceRap2015}.} 
and Williams' basic beat transcriptions.\footnote{
    \autocite[61ff]{justinawilliamsRhyminStealinMusical2013}.} 
From my transcriptions, I work out four terms to methods producers use to affect variety in 
the musical texture:  resampling/recomposing, choking, glitching, and slipping. While this list 
of methods does not exhaust the ways in which producers sound the underground, it demonstrates how 
a hip-hop beat functions as a space for co-creation of variety with the rapper and thus alternative
identity within hip-hop.

Building off this notion, Chapter~\ref{chapter3} examines the comparable role underground emcees play
in composing their verses in rap songs. Although lyrics offer the clearest method for transmitting 
identity, this chapter focuses on emcees' non-textual methods of ``[amplifying] and in some cases 
[transforming] the information that listeners receive'' through texted and visual 
communication.\footnote{
    \autocite[12]{lorenkajikawaSoundingRaceRap2015}.} 
As in my previous chapter, I employ a few methods of transcription to examine different musical
elements. When examining how text is structured to create creates metrical patterns, rhyme schemes, a
and linguistic-syntactic units, I use Mitchell Ohriner's system for visualizing rap flows, which does
feature any qualities of standard musical notation.\footnote{
    For a sample and detailed overview of Ohriner's notational method, see 
    \autocite[xxvii--xl]{mitchellohrinerFlowRhythmicVoice2019}.}
By constrast, when I examine an emcee's approach to performance of text rather than than its structure,
I opt for staff notation, mindful of the its limited ability to denote the complexities of a vocal 
rap performance. Across this performative-structural divide, I draw out four more methods of delivering
flow that underground emcees exhibit: pivot rhyme, closing fragmentation, mimesis, and processing.
Each of these techniques indicate an underground emcee's engagement with similar a listener's expectation,
and in particular techniques of performance challenge perceptions of the vocal object as uniquely or
hierarchical more significant in the musical texture of a rap song.
