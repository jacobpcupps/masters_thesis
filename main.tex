This project is indebted to an always-growing number of people who influence, encourage, 
and inspire me. First, I would like to thank my advisor for this project, Paul Steinbeck, 
as well as my second readers, Lauren Eldridge Stewart and Christopher Stark. The classes 
I've taken as well as the time I've spent in discussion with each of them have helped 
shape this project in distinct and insightful ways. My thanks also goes out to the academic 
mentors I've connected with at Washington University in St. Louis, including Paula Harper 
and Alexander Stefaniak, both of whom have read this project at some point along its 
development.
 
I adamantly believe this project would not be what it is without the camaraderie of the 
graduate students in Wash U's department of music. I am thankful to my colleagues for the 
many hours of discussion and collaboration inside and outside of class, in addition to their 
commitment toward making our department an inclusive and amenable space. In particular, my
thanks go out to my colleagues Eden Attar and Varun Chandrasekhar, both of whom spent time 
writing with me, listening  to the music I studied, and giving me space to workshop my 
ideas in discussion with them.

My friends and family have created an integral community of support around me throughout my 
completion of this project and my time in academia in general. There are more folks to name 
than just the ones here, but a few who have been indispensable to me are my partner Haley 
Jo Mack and my friend Ellie Parker; you both have been there for me as readers, confidants, 
and\textemdash more than anything\textemdash friends. I am uniquely thankful to my brother 
and father, who've kept me afloat in more ways than one throughout my time in school. Indeed,
they deserve the first of my two dedications for this work; truly, I am able to do what I do
because of how my found and biological families have shaped me.
