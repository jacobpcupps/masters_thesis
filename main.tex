This project is indebted to an always-growing number of people who influence, encourage, 
and inspire me. First, I would like to thank my advisor for this project, Paul Steinbeck, 
as well as my second readers, Lauren Eldridge Stewart and Christopher Stark. The classes 
I've taken as well as the time I've spent in discussion with each of you have helped shape
this project in distinct and insightful ways. My thanks also goes out to other academic 
mentors I've connected with at Washington University in St. Louis. I also extend thanks
to Paula Harper and Alexander Stefaniak, both of whom read and provided feedback on papers 
and abstracts that informed my research early on in its development.
 
I adamantly believe this project would not be what it is without the camaraderie of the 
graduate students in Washington University's department of music. I am thankful to all my 
colleagues for the many hours of discussion and collaboration inside and outside of class,
in addition to their commitment toward making our department an inclusive and amenable space.
My special thanks go out to my Eden Attar and Varun Chandrasekhar; I appreciate both of you
for the time spent writing with me, listening to the music I studied, and giving me space to
workshop my ideas.

My friends and family have created an integral community of support around me throughout my 
completion of this project and my time in academia in general. There are more folks to name 
than just the ones here, but a few who have been indispensable to me are my partner Haley 
Jo Mack and my friend Emory Parker; you both have been there for me as readers, confidants, 
and\textemdash more than anything\textemdash a support system. I am similarly thankful to my 
brother and father, Justin and Brian Cupps: you two keep me grounded and have helped me
immensely throughout my time in this program. I would like to dedicate this work to the four
of you because, truly, I am able to do what I do because of how you all have shaped me.
